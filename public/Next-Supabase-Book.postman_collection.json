You tell them things that you’ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you can’t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it’s like being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn’t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day’s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there’s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you’re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that’s so real it scares you.

You tell them things that you’ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you can’t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it’s like being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn’t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day’s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there’s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you’re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that’s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"id\": 232,\n            \"name\": \"Bob Marley\",\n            \"slug\": \"bob-marley\",\n            \"image\": \"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1207771636p5/25241.jpg\"\n        },\n        \"tags\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": 1,\n                \"name\": \"Love\",\n                \"slug\": \"love\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": 25,\n        \"quote\": \"All that is gold does not glitter,Not all those who wander are lost;The old that is strong does not wither,Deep roots are not reached by the frost.From the ashes a fire shall be woken,A light from the shadows shall spring;Renewed shall be blade that was broken,The crownless again shall be king.\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"id\": 8,\n            \"name\": \"J.R.R.

No matter what, you're going to mess up sometimes, it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you're going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"id\": 233,\n            \"name\": \"Marilyn Monroe\",\n            \"slug\": \"marilyn-monroe\",\n            \"image\": \"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1436929110p5/82952.jpg\"\n        },\n        \"tags\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": 3,\n                \"name\": \"Inspirational\",\n                \"slug\": \"inspirational\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 2,\n                \"name\": \"Life\",\n                \"slug\": \"life\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 1,\n                \"name\": \"Love\",\n                \"slug\": \"love\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": 62,\n        \"quote\": \"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"id\": 2,\n            \"name\": \"J.K.

You tell them things that you’ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you can’t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it’s like being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn’t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day’s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there’s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you’re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that’s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.\",\n            \"tags\": \"love,\",\n            \"created_at\": \"2023-05-24T08:31:34.073945+00:00\",\n            \"book_authors\": {\n                \"id\": 232,\n                \"slug\": \"bob-marley\",\n                \"name\": \"Bob Marley\",\n                \"image\": \"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1207771636p5/25241.jpg\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 31,\n            \"author_id\": 10,\n            \"quote\": \"As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.\",\n            \"tags\": \"love,\",\n            \"created_at\": \"2023-05-24T08:31:34.073945+00:00\",\n            \"book_authors\": {\n                \"id\": 10,\n                \"slug\": \"john-green\",\n                \"name\": \"John Green\",\n                \"image\": \"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1353452301p5/1406384.jpg\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 40,\n            \"author_id\": 228,\n            \"quote\": \"It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages.\",\n            \"tags\": \"friendship, lack-of-friendship, lack-of-love, love, marriage, unhappy-marriage,\",\n            \"created_at\": \"2023-05-24T08:31:34.073945+00:00\",\n            \"book_authors\": {\n                \"id\": 228,\n                \"slug\": \"friedrich-nietzsche\",\n                \"name\": \"Friedrich Nietzsche\",\n                \"image\": \"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1651474065p5/1938.jpg\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 41,\n            \"author_id\": 238,\n            \"quote\": \"The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.

You tell them things that you’ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you can’t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it’s like being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn’t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day’s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there’s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you’re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that’s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.\",\n            \"tags\": \"love,\",\n            \"created_at\": \"2023-05-24T08:31:34.073945+00:00\",\n            \"book_authors\": {\n                \"id\": 232,\n                \"slug\": \"bob-marley\",\n                \"name\": \"Bob Marley\",\n                \"image\": \"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1207771636p5/25241.jpg\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 31,\n            \"author_id\": 10,\n            \"quote\": \"As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.\",\n            \"tags\": \"love,\",\n            \"created_at\": \"2023-05-24T08:31:34.073945+00:00\",\n            \"book_authors\": {\n                \"id\": 10,\n                \"slug\": \"john-green\",\n                \"name\": \"John Green\",\n                \"image\": \"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1353452301p5/1406384.jpg\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 40,\n            \"author_id\": 228,\n            \"quote\": \"It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages.\",\n            \"tags\": \"friendship, lack-of-friendship, lack-of-love, love, marriage, unhappy-marriage,\",\n            \"created_at\": \"2023-05-24T08:31:34.073945+00:00\",\n            \"book_authors\": {\n                \"id\": 228,\n                \"slug\": \"friedrich-nietzsche\",\n                \"name\": \"Friedrich Nietzsche\",\n                \"image\": \"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1651474065p5/1938.jpg\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 41,\n            \"author_id\": 238,\n            \"quote\": \"The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.

And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything.

The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 181,\n            \"created_at\": \"2023-05-24T08:44:31.337685+00:00\",\n            \"author_id\": 1,\n            \"title\": \"The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxset (The Hunger Games #1-3)\",\n            \"isbn\": \"9780545265355\",\n            \"language\": \"English\",\n            \"pages\": \"1155\",\n            \"published\": \"2008-01-01\",\n            \"genre\": \"Young Adult, Fiction, Fantasy, Dystopia, Science Fiction, Romance, Adventure\",\n            \"rating\": \"4.49 avg rating - 212.401 ratings\",\n            \"score\": \"91.647\",\n            \"vote\": \"1.078\",\n            \"link\": \"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7938275-the-hunger-games-trilogy-boxset\",\n            \"image\": \"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1360094673i/7938275.jpg\",\n            \"image_small\": \"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1360094673i/7938275._SY75_.jpg\",\n            \"description\": \"The extraordinary, ground breaking New York Times bestsellers The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, along with the third book in The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins, Mockingjay, are available for the first time ever in a beautiful boxset edition.

Flames are spreading. And the Capitol wants revenge. Against all odds, Katniss Everdeen has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol—a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create. Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest that she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying. In Catching Fire, the second novel of the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before . . . and surprising readers at every turn.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 290,\n            \"created_at\": \"2023-05-24T08:44:31.337685+00:00\",\n            \"author_id\": 1,\n            \"title\": \"Mockingjay (The Hunger Games #3)\",\n            \"isbn\": \"9780439023511\",\n            \"language\": \"English\",\n            \"pages\": \"390\",\n            \"published\": \"2010-08-24\",\n            \"genre\": \"Young Adult, Dystopia, Fiction, Fantasy, Science Fiction, Romance, Adventure\",\n            \"rating\": \"4.07 avg rating - 2.955.359 ratings\",\n            \"score\": \"50.128\",\n            \"vote\": \"637\",\n            \"link\": \"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7260188-mockingjay\",\n            \"image\": \"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1586722918i/7260188.jpg\",\n            \"image_small\": \"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1586722918i/7260188._SY75_.jpg\",\n            \"description\": \"My name is Katniss Everdeen.

District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans—except Katniss. The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay—no matter what the personal cost.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"authors\": []\n}"
